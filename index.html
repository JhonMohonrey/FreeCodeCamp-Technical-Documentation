            A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 
            Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
            Statements should end with a semicolon. 
           </p>
           <p>
            We will look at what the code on the right does 
            shortly, but for the moment note that:
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                Each of the lines of code in green is a statement. 
               </li>
               <li>
                The pink curly braces indicate the start and end 
                of a code block. (Each code block could contain 
                many more statements.)
               </li>
               <li>
                The code in purple determines which code 
                should run.
               </li>
           </ul>
           <h4>
            JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE 
           </h4>
           <p>
            JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means 
            something different to HourNow or HOURNOW. 
           </p>
           <h4>
            STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND 
            EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE 
           </h4>
           <p>
            A statement is an individual instruction that the 
            computer should follow. Each one should start on a 
            new line and end with a semicolon. This makes your 
            code easier to read and follow. 
            The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter 
            when a step is over, indicating that it should move 
            to the next step. 
           </p>
           <h4>
            STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED 
            INTO CODE BLOCKS 
           </h4>
           <p>
            Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; 
            these are known as code blocks. The closing curly 
            brace is not followed by a semicolon. 
            Above, each code block contains one statement 
            related to what the current time is. Code blocks 
            will often be used to group together many more 
            statements. This helps programmers organize their 
            code and makes it more readable. 
            
           </p>

            <header>COMMENTS</header>
           <p>
            You should write comments to explain what your code does. 
            They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
            This can help you and others who read your code. 
           </p>
           <h4>MULTI-LINE COMM ENTS</h4>
           <p>
                To write a comment that stretches over more than 
                one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with 
                the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. 
                Anything between these characters is not processedÂ· 
                by the JavaScript interpreter. 
                M ulti-line comment s are often used for descriptions 
                of how the script works, or to prevent a section of 
                the script from running when testing it. 
           </p>
           <h4>
              SINGLE-LINE COMMENTS
           </h4>
           <p>
            In a single-line comment, anything that follows the 
            two forward slash characters I/ on that line will not 
            be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Singleline comments are often used for short descriptions 
            of what the code is doing. 
            Good use of comments will help you if you come 
            back to your code after several days or months. 
            They also help those who are new to your code. 
           </p>

            <header>WHAT IS A VARIABLE?</header>
           <p>
                A script will have to temporarily 
                store the bits of information it 
                needs to do its job. It can store this 
                data in variables. 
                When you write JavaScript, you have to tell the 
                interpreter every individual step that you want it to 
                perform. This sometimes involves more detail than 
                you might expect. 
                Think about calculating the area of a wall; in math 
                the area of a rectangle is obtained by multiplying two 
                numbers:
           </p>
           <div class="codes">
               <code>
                   <span class="green">
                    width x height = area
                   </span>
               </code>
           </div>
           <p>
                You may be able to do calculations like this in 
                your head, bu t when writing a script to do this 
                calculation, you need to give the computer very 
                detailed instructions. You might tell it to perform the 
                following four steps in order: 
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>Remember the value for width </li>
               <li>Remember the value for height </li>
               <li>Multiply width by height to get the area</li>
               <li>Return the result to the user </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
                In this case, you would use variables to "remember" 
                the values for width and height. (This also illustrates 
                how a scrip( contains very explicit instructions about 
                exactly what you want the computer to do.) 
                You can compare variables to short-term memory, 
                because once you leave the page, the browser will 
                forget any information it holds. 
                A variable is a good name for this 
                concept because the data stored 
                in a variable can change (or vary) 
                each time a script runs. 
                No matter what the dimensions of any individual 
                wall are, you know that you can find its area by 
                multiplying the width of that wall by its height. 
                Similarly, scripts often need to achieve the same 
                goal even when they are run with different data, so 
                variables can be used to represent values in your 
                scripts that are likely to change. The result is said to 
                be calculated or computed using the data stored in 
                the variables. 
                The use of variables to represent numbers or other 
                kinds of data is very similar to the concept of algebra 
                (where le.tters are used to represent numbers). 
                There is one key difference, however. The equals 
                sign does something very different in programming 
                (as you will see on the next two pages).
           </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="DATA_TYPES">
            <header>DATA TYPES</header>
           <p>
                JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, 
                strings, and true or false values known as 
                Booleans. 
           </p>
           <h4>
            NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
            The numeric data type handles 
            numbers.
           </h4>
           <ul>
               <li>0.75 </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            For tasks that involve counting 
            or calculating sums, you will 
            use numbers 0-9. For example, 
            five thousand, two hundred and 
            seventy-two would be written 
            5272 (note there is no comma 
            between the thousands and 
            the hundreds). You can also 
            have negative numbers (such 
            as -23678) and decimals (three 
            quarters is written as 0.75). 
           </p>

           <h4>
            STRING DATA TYPE
           </h4>
           <p>
            The strings data type consists of 
            letters and other characters. 
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                'H. 1 ' Ivy! 1
               </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Note how the string data type is 
            enclosed within a pair of quotes. 
            These can be single or double 
            quotes, but the opening quote 
            must match the closing quote.
            Strings can be used when 
            working with any kind of text. 
            They are frequently used to add 
            new content into a page and they 
            can contain HTML markup. 
           </p>
           <h4>
            BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
           </h4>
           <p>
            Boolean data types can have one 
            of two values: true or false. 
           </p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                true
               </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It might seem a little abstract at 
            first, but the Boolean data type is 
            actually very helpful. You can think of it a little like a 
            light switch - it is either on or off. 
            As you will see in Chapter 4, 
            Booleans are helpful when 
            determining which part of a 
            script should run.

            <header>RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES</header>
            <p>
                Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
            </p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                The name must begin with 
                a letter, dollar sign ($),or an 
                underscore (_). It must not start 
                with a number.
               </li>
               <li>
                The name can contain letters, 
                numbers, dollar sign ($), or an 
                underscore (_). Note that you 
                must not use a dash(-) or a 
                period (.) in a variable name. 
               </li>
               <li>
                You cannot use keywords or 
                reserved words. Keywords 
                are special words that tell the 
                interpreter to do something. For 
                example, var is a keyword used 
                to declare a variable. Reserved 
                words are ones that may be used 
                in a future version of JavaScript.

                reserved words in JavaScript. 
               </li>
               <li>
                All variables are case sensitive, 
                so score and Score would be 
                different variable names, but 
                it is bad practice to create two 
                variables that have the same 
                name using different cases. 
               </li>
               <li>
                Use a name that describes the 
                kind of information that the 
                variable stores. For example, 
                fi rstName might be used to 
                store a person's first name, 
                l astNarne for their last name, 
                and age for their age.
               </li>
               <li>
                If your variable name is made 
                up of more than one word, use a 
                capital letter for the first letter of 
                every word after the first word. 
                For example, f i rstName rather 
                than fi rstnarne (this is referred 
                to as camel case). You can also 
                use an underscore between each 
                word (you cannot use a dash).
